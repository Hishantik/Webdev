      <strong>Samurai (‰æç)</strong> were the hereditary military nobility and officer
      caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until
      their abolition in 1876. They were the well-paid retainers of the daimyo
      (the great feudal landholders). They had high prestige and special
      privileges such as wearing two swords and Kiri-sute gomen (right to kill
      anyone of a lower class in certain situations). They cultivated the
      bushido codes of martial virtues, indifference to pain, and unflinching
      loyalty, engaging in many local battles. Though they had predecessors in
      earlier military and administrative officers, the samurai truly emerged
      during the Kamakura shogunate, ruling from c.1185 to 1333.<em> They became the
      ruling political class, with significant power but also significant
      responsibility. During the 13th century, the samurai proved themselves as
      adept warriors against the invading Mongols.</em>

      <em>During the peaceful Edo era
      (1603 to 1868), they became the stewards and chamberlains of the daimyo
      estates, gaining managerial experience and education.</em> In the 1870s,
      samurai families comprised 5% of the population. As modern militaries
      emerged in the 19th century, the samurai were rendered increasingly
      obsolete and very expensive to maintain compared to the average conscript
      soldier. The Meiji Restoration ended their feudal roles, and they moved
      into professional and entrepreneurial roles. Their memory and weaponry
      remain prominent in Japanese popular culture.
