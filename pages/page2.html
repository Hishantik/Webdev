      In Japanese, historical warriors are usually referred to as bushi (武士,
      [bɯ.ɕi]), meaning 'warrior', or buke (武家), meaning 'military family'.
      According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character
      侍 was originally a verb meaning 'to wait upon', 'accompany persons' in
      the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in
      Japanese, saburau. In both countries the terms were nominalized to mean
      'those who serve in close attendance to the nobility', the Japanese term
      saburai being the nominal form of the verb." According to Wilson, an early
      reference to the word saburai appears in the Kokin Wakashū, the first
      imperial anthology of poems, completed in the early 900s.[5] In modern
      usage, bushi is often used as a synonym for samurai;[6][7][8] however,
      historical sources make it clear that bushi and samurai were distinct
      concepts, with the former referring to soldiers or warriors and the latter
      referring instead to a kind of hereditary nobility.[9][10] The word
      samurai is now closely associated with the middle and upper echelons of
      the warrior class. These warriors were usually associated with a clan and
      their lord, and were trained as officers in military tactics and grand
      strategy. While these samurai numbered less than 10% of then Japan's
      population,[11] their teachings can still be found today in both everyday
      life and in modern Japanese martial arts.
